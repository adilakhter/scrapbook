## Functional Programming

Articles, videos, blog posts, papers, related to the theory and advances of Functional Programming,
but not specifically tied to implementations in Haskell or Scala. 

- February 16th 2019: [Freer doesnâ€™t come for free](https://medium.com/barely-functional/freer-doesnt-come-for-free-c9fade793501), a blog post by Eric Terreborre, concerning the disadvantages and downsides of using the `Freer` monad for handling effects. 

- June 23rd 2019: [The Simple Essence of Automatic Differentiation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne99laPUxN4]). A talk by Conal Elliott in the Microsoft Research offices. He describes the alternative, derived by Category Theory, for automatically computing derivatives of any function at any point. His generalisation is not constrained to a specific input or output domain (scalars / vectors / matrices / tensors), but instead is generalised to any Cartesian Category. 

- June 25th 2019: [YOW! Lambda Jam 2017 Conal Elliott - Teaching New Tricks to Old Programs ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzLK_xE9Zy8), a presentation on a paper called "Compiling to Categories".
